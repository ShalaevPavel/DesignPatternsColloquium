##Abstract Factory
Logic for helping a developer choose a DB. I used Abstract Factory design pattern to initially let user choose whether he/she wants to use a relational or non-relational DB(via ChooseTypeOfDB). Then user is provided with a distinct DBs themselves( MongoDB, FileMaker and Orakle Berkley DB) for non-relational DB and (SQL type DBs) for relational. Each DB has its own methods (add note to db, delete from db and read note from db).
##Template Method
Common template for engineers to built vehicles with similar actions such as arrive, leave and refuel. And to simple examples( plane, car).
